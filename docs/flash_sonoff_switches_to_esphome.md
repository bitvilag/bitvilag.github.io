Description

This page will show you one method (and might be the easiest of all) to upload/flash ESPHOME on your existing sonoff switches.

Steps

- Get an UART device
- Get some cables
- Get a Windows Machine (as this guide will not show how to do it on Linux)
- Have a running HA with ESPHOME add-on installed
- Have a wellthought naming convention as later it is hard to change the names
- Have knowledge of IP/DHCP if you have more than VLAN
